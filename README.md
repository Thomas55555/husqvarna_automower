## About

This Home Assistant integration provides status and control of supported Husqvarna  Automowers.  The official Husqvarna  [API](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/) uses websocket connection for pushed updates, so no polling is performed.  Park and Start commands including schedule overrides are supported by the integration allowing for robust automations to be implemented in Home Assistant.  Diagnostic and statics provided by the API are included with the integration for monitoring mower usage and performance.

## Configuration


### Husqvarna API-Key

In order to use this integration you must properly configure OAuth2 credentials using your Husqvarna account.  Refer to [this guide](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/docs/get-started) for general overview of the process.  Username/password authentication for this integration is no longer supported as of version 2022.7.0.

Your Husqvarna account username/password used for the *Automower® Connect*  phone app is required.  Most users probably created a Husqvarna account during initial mower setup.

1. Make sure, that the exgernal url on the page `Settings -> Network` in the field `Internet` is set to your external url.

2. Go to <https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/> and sign in with Husqvarna account.  Sign in page has password recovery/reset using registered email address if needed.  Authorize *Developer Porthole* to access Husqvarna account when prompted.

3. After signing in you will be automatically redirected to "Your applications". (Otherwise go to: <https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/applications>)

4. Create a new application:

   * Name is required but can be anything, for example "My Home Assistant"

   * Description is optional

   * Redirect URL:

     ```
     https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth
     ```

     Confirm no extra spaces were appended at end of URL from copy and paste.

   * Click **CREATE**.  *Application Key* and *Application Secret* will be generated and shown.  Protect these like a username and password.

5. Click on **CONNECT NEW API** and connect the **Authentication API**.

6. Click on **CONNECT NEW API** again and connect the **Husqvarna Automower API**.

7. Leave this tab open in browser and continue with Home Assistant configuration.

### Home Assistant

The My Home Assistant redirect feature needs to be setup to redirect to your home assistant installation.  See https://my.home-assistant.io/faq/ for additional information.

1. Add the integration to your home assistant installation and test the redirect feature by following below link:
   [![my_button](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=husqvarna_automower)

2. Acknowledge prompts to open link, install Husqvarna Automower integration.

3. Acknowledge prompt to setup application credentials.

4. Enter the following from the Husqvrana developer tab:

   * The name of the application assigned in Step 3 above
   * Copy and paste the *Application Key* into the *OAuth Client ID* field
   * Copy and paste the *Application Secret* into the *OAuth Client Secret* field

5. Click **Create**

6. Browser will be redirected to Husqvarna Developer site.  Sign in and Authorize the integration to connect with your Husqvarna account

7. After authorizing the integration the browser will show the my Home Assistant redirect link to link this account.  Click on **Link Account**.

8. Confirm successful connection of mower and assign to an HA area if desired.

### Camera Sensor

The camera entity is disabled by default.  The camera entity will plot the current coordinates and location history of the mower on a user provided image. To configure the entity you need to upload your desired map image and determine the coordinates of the top left corner and the bottom right corner of your selected image.

The camera entity is configured via the configure option on the integration. To enter the coordinates, ensure that they are in Signed Degree format and separated by a comma for example: `40.689209,-74.044661`

You can then provide the path to the image you would like to use for the map and mower.  This has been tested with the PNG format, other formats may work.  The `.../resources/map_image.png` default image is over written when the integration is updated, store the custom image in another location.

## Usage

* `vacuum.start`
  The mower continues to mow, within the specified schedule

* `vacuum.pause`

    end: '21:30:00'
    monday: true
    tuesday: true
    wednesday: true
    thursday: true
    friday: true

    - platform: time
      at: "23:58"
  action:
    service: husqvarna_automower.calendar
    data:
      start: '{{ states("sensor.sun_next_rising") | as_timestamp| timestamp_custom("%H:%M") }}'
      end: '{{ states("sensor.sun_next_setting") | as_timestamp| timestamp_custom("%H:%M") }}'
      monday: true
      tuesday: true
      wednesday: true
      thursday: true

## Debugging

To enable debug logging for this integration and related libraries you can control this in your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file.

Example:

```
logger:
